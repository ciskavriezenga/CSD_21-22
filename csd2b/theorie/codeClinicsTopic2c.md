# Content Code clinics topics
Notepad to keep track of possibly interesting topics for code clinics during
the course CSD2c.

## Datastructures
* #### set
  * explain functionality of set
  * ask for and share example of when this is useful
  * rewrite of xx_eindopdrachtExamples/06_ choices --> let's use a set instead
    of an area for the choice options:
      * alter functions to use set instad of array
      * move functionality from main to synth --> set<std::string> getOptionsSet


## Design Patterns
* #### Observer pattern
  * demonstrate observer pattern with an example
    (SerialManager and AudioManager) from previous cppExamples repository


## Pointers
* #### recap and additional theory
  * dynamic array allocation
  * copy object vs copy pointer example of Marc
  * pointer exercises


## Optimalisation
* #### Faster oscillators
  * Sine vs 'fast sine'
  * Saw with additive sines vs 'fast sine'

* #### The processor-memory bottleneck:
  * explain this bottleneck
  * caching - how does this work
    * demo with windows visualisation of the cache project

* #### SIMD
